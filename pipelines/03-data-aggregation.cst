# 03 — Data Aggregation
# Demonstrates: built-in data modules (SumList, Average, Max, Min,
#               FilterGreaterThan, MultiplyEach, Range, FormatNumber)
#
# Shows numeric list processing and aggregation.

in numbers: List<Int>
in threshold: Int

# Aggregation
total   = SumList(numbers)
avg     = Average(numbers)
highest = Max(numbers)
lowest  = Min(numbers)

# Transformation
filtered = FilterGreaterThan(numbers, threshold)
doubled  = MultiplyEach(numbers, 2)

# Generation and formatting
sequence  = Range(1, 10)
formatted = FormatNumber(total)
